input.raw {#input}
==========

Open data stream from client device to server.

Request
------------
JSON object in request content is not allowed. 
Query string
`https://localhost/output.raw?shash=string&subproto=string&delta=integer`
The content of the request must contain [formatted](Data-stream-format.md) frames data.

<h3>Parameters</h3>

* _**shash**_ - session id (required)
* _**subproto**_ - the sub-protocol description (optional)
* _**delta**_ - the maximum time interval between two consecutive frames in ms (optional)


Sub-protocol
------------

There are no requirements for naming subprotocols. The set and description of subprotocols is determined within the account, since the encoding and decoding of frames is carried out on the client side. The specification describes only recommendations for the formation of similar names of subprotocols. The general format of the name of the subprotocol is as follows:

`(COMPRESSION){1}_(FORMAT){1}(_[A-Z0-9]+)*`

Examples:
`DEFLATE_TEXT`
`RAW_JPEG`
`DEFLATE_JSON`
`LZMA_FILE_HEADER128B`

Response
------------

There is no formatted response. If an error occurs, the stream is closed by the host.

Example
------------
```
curl --http2 -k --data-binary '@data.raw' -X POST https://localhost:8080/addRecordData.json?shash=ra5PNJRgzrqpwbfw8JvHIkWuxJE%3D&subproto=RAW_JPEG
```
