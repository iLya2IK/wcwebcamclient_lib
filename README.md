# wcWebCamClient Library

This is a library for convenient client work with the wcWebCamServer server via the JSON protocol.

## The structure of the client-server software package
The server designed to collect images and data streams from cameras (devices) and forwards messages between devices to control the periphery via an HTTP 2 connection is [wcwebcamserver (Lazarus/Free Pascal)](https://github.com/iLya2IK/wcwebcamserver).
Abstract client for Lazarus is [wccurlclient (Lazarus/Free Pascal)](https://github.com/iLya2IK/wccurlclient).
A detailed implementation of an external device based on "ESP32-CAM" is given in the example [webcamdevice (ะก)](https://github.com/iLya2IK/webcamdevice).
The example of a desktop application for external device controlling and viewing images is [webcamclientviewer (Lazarus)](https://github.com/iLya2IK/webcamclientviewer).
An example of an Android application for controlling external devices, chatting and streaming is [wcwebcameracontrol (Java)](https://github.com/iLya2IK/wcwebcameracontrol).
